# Game Made in C++
We decided to make a game inspired by the 1990's game [Angband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband_%28video_game%29). Played in the terminal.

To run this game rememeber to drop the 3 dll files from the [irrKlang Library (64x)](https://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/downloads.html) into the debug folder/in the folder with the game.exe file. This also goes for the audio folder. This folder is required to have audio in game so place it into the same folder as the exe file.
